# Portfolio-Website
This portfolio website project was created using HTML and CSS. Grok was used to assist, as was Uiverse.io for most of the buttons, and [Oskar Frantti Glen](https://github.com/OskarFranttiGlen)  as the inspiration for the layout of this site.
Changes have been made including adding animations to the chips in the skills section (placeholder skills, not my skills), animated buttons in the navbar to take you to the respective section of the site, animated titles and cool buttons. 

DISCLAIMER: This was a project in collaboration with GrokAI and I'm making no claims as to my skills, education, experience, or the creativity to come up with this specific website layout. The bio, about me, skills, and experience section have been modified.
